Due to the Unity package importer being strictly additive and not handling file deletions, renames, or moves well; we recommend you fully delete your Assets/LeapMotion/ and Assets/LeapMotion+OVR/ (if applicable) folders before importing this updated package into your project. This will also be a likely requirement for future projects.

We recommend that any new prefabs or scripts you write be stored outside the LeapMotion and LeapMotion+OVR folders to make these updates easier.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions on the LeapMotion developer forums at: https://community.leapmotion.com/c/development
